# Cull-Analysis
Computational comparison of Cull vs Doran's Blade start with cut down.

Comparing HP and AD statistics from Doran's Blade and Cull we get:  
Doran's Blade: 80 HP and 8 AD  
Cull: 7 AD  

Therefore, Cull is missing 1 AD and 80 HP in combat stats.  

Converting that to pure AD using gold as a common denominator:
400g for 150 HP from Ruby Crystal means 1 HP is roughly 2.66g  
350g for 10 AD from Long Sword means 1 AD is roughly 35g  

Therefore, 80 HP to AD is...  
80 HP to gold is 80*2.66 = 212.8  
212.8 gold to AD is 212.8/35 = 6.08  

Therefore, Cull is roughly missing 7 AD from a combat statistics perspective.  

We include absolute focus but exclude gathering storm as this primarily focuses on early levels and gathering storm only starts giving value after 10.
